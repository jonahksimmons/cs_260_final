				<h2 class="section-title">Setting the stage</h2>
				<p class="story text-body">The situation is all too familiar. We take on a project too ambitious for our skill level and hit a bug we can not seem to fix. We tear our hair out trying to solve it on our own, but eventually seek guidance from a friend or cry out to Stack Overflow for help. We are either met with nothing, a snarky response, or an answer that completely misses the mark. We conclude that the world hates us and decide to go play Minecraft instead.
				<br/><br/>
				No one is perfect; us programmers know this all too well. Handling the inevitable problems in our code is vital not only to your ability to get the task done, but also to learn and grow as a developer. When we don't know the solution ourselves, we ask others for advice. But why do some of our questions go unanswered while others are quickly attended to? The common culprit is the quality of our questions.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">What is a "good" question?</h2>
				<p class="text-body">There are many ways of approaching such a topic. For this, the goal is to make questions that people will answer. Not only should the question be easy to read, but it should offer the reader everything they need to answer it. Aside from readability and other basic attributes, technical questions require some important pieces of information if you want solutions.
				<br/><br/>
				From almost ten years of generating errors and fixing the errors of others, these are the most important guidelines for writing technical questions.</p>

		<div id="give-background" class="step">
			<h2 class="section-title">Give background</h2>
			<p class="text-body">This is often the most overlooked part. Every project is set up differently and is made up of many moving parts. What language is it written in? What framework or libraries does it use? What platforms are you targeting?</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p class="example"><span class="selected">I'm writing a bash script</span> to search through a file for multiple strings, but it always shows nothing. Running it produces an error code of 1. This is the command I'm using:</p>
				<code class="example">cat users.txt | grep "Name" | grep "Age"</code>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="goal" class="step">
			<h2 class="section-title">Say what you want it to do</h2>
			<p class="text-body">Knowing the error messages is helpful, but knowing what you want to do is even more helpful. The issue you are having could be your syntax, but it could also be your approach. What purpose do you want this part of your program to solve? How do you want it to fit into the rest of your project?</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p class="example">I'm writing a bash script <span class="selected">to search through a file for multiple strings,</span> but it always shows nothing. Running it produces an error code of 1. This is the command I'm using:</p>
				<code class="example">cat users.txt | grep "Name" | grep "Age"</code>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="actual-output" class="step">
			<h2 class="section-title">Explain what it actually does</h2>
			<p class="text-body">Now list the problem. This could include error messages, command line output, or anything else that the program interacts with.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p class="example">I'm writing a bash script to search through a file for multiple strings, <span class="selected">but it always shows nothing.</span> Running it produces an error code of 1. This is the command I'm using:</p>
				<code class="example">cat users.txt | grep "Name" | grep "Age"</code>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="more-info" class="step">
			<h2 class="section-title">More info is better than less info</h2>
			<p class="text-body">If you have error messages, show the full message. If you are working on a front end, show screenshots. This can save a lot of back and forth with people asking for logs or stack traces.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p class="example">I'm writing a bash script to search through a file for multiple strings, but it always shows nothing. <span class="selected">Running it produces an error code of 1.</span> This is the command I'm using:</p>
				<code class="example">cat users.txt | grep "Name" | grep "Age"</code>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="relevant-code" class="step">
			<h2 class="section-title">Show relevant code</h2>
			<p class="text-body">Although it might be tempting, don't just skip to this step. It is really important, but harder to decipher without the previous information.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p class="example">I'm writing a bash script to search through a file for multiple strings, but it always shows nothing. Running it produces and error code of 1. <span class="selected">This is the command I'm using:</span></p>
				<code class="example selected">cat users.txt | grep "Name" | grep "Age"</code>

			<h2 class="section-title">Summary</h2>
			<p id="summary">Asking questions is really important for learning and asking good questions help speed up that growth. Hopefully this guide will aid you when you next cry into the cold, unforgiving void of Stack Overflow or bug a senior dev for the 100th time. And maybe, just maybe, you will get a answer to match the high quality of your question.</p>
