# Cs 260 Final project
Test of what could be done with just html and css. Note that this only works on full screen desktop as of now. I learned a lot about design, writting, and web development through this and hope you find it educational or interesting. 


## Inspiration
From our lesson in CSS, we were shown [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com/) and I was so intrigued. It was incredible to see what they could do with such simple technologies. I find working with restrictions very interesting and fun and typically am drawn to minimalism. I decided to see what I could do with just one HTML and CSS file (excluding pictures).


## Deploying
